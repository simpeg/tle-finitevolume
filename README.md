These notebooks use [Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/) and the open source packages [SimPEG](https://simpeg.xyz) and [discretize](https://discretize.simpeg.xyz).
[SimPEG](https://simpeg.xyz) can be installed using the Python package manager `PyPi` or `conda` and running:

```bash
conda install SimPEG --channel conda-forge
```

For working locally:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pixels
```

**Overview**

In [index.ipynb](/notebooks/index.ipynb), we first give an overview and introduce the problem, in [mesh.ipynb](/notebooks/mesh.ipynb) we show how to create and work with a regular mesh, in [divergence.ipynb](/notebooks/divergence.ipynb) we build the discrete divergence operator, and in [weak-formulation.ipynb](/notebooks/weak-formulation.ipynb), we discretize and solve the DC equations using weak formulation. Finally we bring it all together with an interactive app in [all-together-now.ipynb](/notebooks/all-together-now.ipynb)
